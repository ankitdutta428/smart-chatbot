620,"Hello doctor, I have a stiffness of neck and pain which continues to the back further. This often happens when a stressful situation arises, which also raises my BP. Worries related to health and other life concerns keep bothering me. Please suggest.","Hello. From your symptoms, it seems like fibromyalgia with anxiety. Whenever we are anxious, our autonomic nervous system plays a role, and hence increases the blood flow to various organs by pumping more blood at higher rates, and thus heartbeats can be felt by us. Also, when we are subjected to constant stress, those muscles become stiff. And thus, due to constant tension in them, they hurt after some time because of lactic acid accumulation. Your BP (blood pressure) is also because of stress and not medical hypertension. I would like to know more about your symptoms. Let me know about the details so that I can help you further. Take care. Revert with more information to a psychiatrist online -->",HC,0

3404,"Hi doctor, I am a lactating mother. I feel dizzy and weak. My BP is 100/60. What should I do for this? What diet should I follow? Please guide.","Hi. Your blood pressure (BP) is absolutely normal. There are various reasons for your tiredness and weakness which are as follows. The wrong position of breastfeeding may cause back pain and tiredness. You should not bend your back while breastfeeding. Put some pillows behind your back and raise the baby to your breast and feed. Tiredness may also be due to blood loss and anemia during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the child takes up a lot of iron from the mother and also during breastfeeding. Check your hemoglobin level and contact me. You may also feel tired and weak due to lack of calcium. For which start taking more milk, curd, vegetables, and fruits. Start taking calcium and multivitamin tablets if needed. Less sleep can also make you tired.

4978,"Hello doctor, My age is 18 years. I had a root canal last year. I have many cavities in my teeth. I brush three times a day nicely then also cavities grow up and come on other teeth. Please tell me any of your solutions.","Hello. I have been through your query and I can understand your concern. The cavities (caries) have many causes to occur in the mouth. And overall cleaning with proper technique of brushing and flossing is essential to maintain good oral hygiene. Good oral hygiene with regular dental check-ups will ensure no cavities in the future. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist and get the remaining cavities filled (restored). And have a proper cleaning and scaling done for the teeth. In order for proper brushing technique, ask the dentist you visit to show you the suitable and proper brushing technique. As for now, you can search the modified bass technique for brushing your teeth. Be gentle while brushing. Always brush after breakfast in the morning and after the dinner (before sleeping) in the night. Do regular oral rinses after having meals and floss regularly in order to ward off the cavities. Also, come for the regular dental checkups after six months to your nearest dentist (dental check ups will cost merely some bucks which is better than one time huge amount to spend and that too for drilling and filling your teeth). Maintain good oral hygiene and follow above said things and I can assure you that your teeth will never get any cavities.",HC,0

5422,"Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

5452,"Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old male, height is 1.75 and weight is 83. The doctor has diagnosed premature ejaculation problem.

The family is discussing marriage, so I was thinking about my sexual problem. I need solutions for premature ejaculation problem, and strengthen my penis.","Hi. Masturbation per se does not cause any sexual problem in the future life, so do not worry excessively about it. However, to manage premature ejaculation you can learn about the start-stop technique or squeeze technique. There are medications available for this purpose like Dapoxetine 30 mg one hour prior to sexual activity. Also, get yourself investigated to rule out medical conditions such as thyroid dysfunction or diabetes hypertension, etc. Also, try Keigal exercise to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.",HC,0
5540,"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

26821,"Hello doctor, Every once a month at least I get a flare up of diarrhea where I go at least six times a day and nothing seems to settle my stomach. The stool itself has a weird texture, almost sand-like. Most of it float down but some do float up and there is mucus in it. Other symptoms I am experiencing are lethargy, feeling of being full yet hungry, loss of appetite, and dry mouth. Any idea of what this could be?","Hello. Do you have lost some weight since the start of symptoms? Do you have noticed any triggers (diets, stress, change in lifestyle, or drinking alcohol ) before such episodes? Alcohol has a large amount of fermentable carbohydrates which can cause diarrhea, gas, and bloating, often episodes of binge drinking. The common possibilities are that you have one of the above trigger which causes your gastrointestinal (GI) upsets. They can go unrecognized with episodes of symptoms as in your case. The other possibility is endometriosis. Endometrium is the lining of the uterine cavity of the female internal genital tract. In menstruation, the lining sheds causing bleeding and pain. Endometriosis is a condition where endometrial tissue is implanted into gut, and it behaves similarly as one has menstruation on monthly cycles. It causes pain (at times very severe), diarrhea, and even bleeding from the gut. It is important that you notice yourself the temporal (time) relation between the onset of symptoms and onset of menstruation. I want that you should provide me more information, as I can be able to investigate you properly in a specific direction, providing you target management plan which can fit you best. I hope this helps. Cyclical abdominal symptoms. Endometriosis. Celiac disease. Food allergies. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Endometriosis. Environmental triggers.

I have gone off the pristiq 5 days ago cold turkey ... and I know all the advise is to taper etc etc.. but to taper at 10% per month it will take me 9 months to get off them. My question is how can I help myself through the withdrawal symptoms with out taking more drugs?","Hello Pristiq is Desvenlafaxine. This is a SNRI group of anti-depressant drug. The drug acts by increasing serotonin and nor-epinephrin neurotransmission in brain. It cause changes at molecular level so abrupt stoppage of use result in rebound effects and consequent withdrawal syndrome. Though the withdrawal doesn't result in serious complications still it can prove distressing. Consult a Psychiatrist for help in withdrawal and how to taper drug. Normally one should decrease dose at about 25% every 4 weeks and in 8-12 weeks medicine can be stopped completely. But that too depends upon the initial dose of drug. To prevent withdrawal symptoms without drug I would advise you to take plenty of water, take diets rich in protein and carbohydrates. Avoid alcohol or any other recreational drug.

44177,"My question is quite simple, I am 54 years old, for the longest I can remember I have had a problem with having a hard time with crying. I don t consider myself a wimp, I served over 20 years in the Army, my mother passed when I was 11 and I was responsible for the majority of my growing up, my dad was military, I ve served in combat twice and was the only person who would make the call when my father was terminal in the hospital to remove him from life support. To each of these things I ve dealt with with minimal problems. However in many of the personal situations I ve found myself in I had a hard time holding back tears , same as in a emotional movie, or a situation you may find on tv where a person (etc... kidnapped and recovered, saved from sure death) would cause me to cry. I am concerned about what would cause me to cry so easily in some situations and others not respond except in the way expected.

Though my bag of water broke 3 days before the baby arrived & the doctor that I was seeing then kept telling me it was nothing, that maybe the baby was on my bladder. Until the day I almost fainted on the road & was rushed to the hospital by a good Nigerian. After some hrs the baby came & weighed 1.6kg, she stayed in the incubator for almost 4 weeks.

Pls I ll want you to assist me by telling me I should do cause I wouldn t want to have any other problem with this pregnancy. Thank You very much.","Hi there,,What you underwent in last pregnancy is premature rupture of membranes which led to a preterm delivery, which can have long term effects on the baby.If you have had a preterm baby in a previous pregnancy, you are also more likely to have another preterm in this pregnancy. You will need to take precautions for the same, if at any time you have a urine infection or vaginal infection in this pregnancy get immediate treatment for the same.Infection is one of the most common and avoidable causes of rupture of membranes and preterm birth.Also you need to check for the length of the cervix ( neck of the womb) from the 3 rd month on wards if at any point it starts opening or measures less than 2.5 cms you should consider a procedure called cervical circlage where they tie a suture at the neck of the womb to prevent further opening.Also if you start having pains take the steroid dose for the optimal lung development of the baby.Hope this helps.Regards.",HC,0

If you have always been regular with your cycles and are sexually active, you need to exclude/confirm pregnancy in the current scenario. An estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres along with a trans-vaginal sonogram is the best way out to clarify the situation. Your symptoms can happen with a very early pregnancy but a proper confirmation is necessary. If positive, this spotting should be monitored, the viability of the pregnancy assessed and further management given. Hope this helps.",HC,0
52158,"hi,i am 7 months pregnant on my second child.had a kidney infection last week,and was with my doctor today.there is now protein and puss in my urine,and has been sent to the hospital for the urine to be examined.is this normal in pregnancy and what causes it..","Hello, I hope I can help you today.Protein in the urine during pregnancy can have many causes, including urinary tract infection of the bladder and/or kidneys. Furthermore, the pus, or white blood cells, in your urine can also be an indication of continuing infection. Therefore, if you had a kidney infection the week before, your doctor may be sending your urine to the hospital to be analyzed for culture to make sure your urinary infection is gone.Untreated kidney infections can be dangerous during pregnancy because the bacteria from your urine can actually pass to the blood and affect your whole body, a condition called sepsis, which can cause severe complications for both the mother and fetus.Sometimes, a kidney infection cannot be cured with oral antibiotics alone, and women need to actually be admitted to the hospital to effectively complete treatment.So I suggest that you follow your doctor's advice, and depending upon the results of your urine test, you may need additional antibiotics or even inpatient admission for treatment of your condition.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown",HC,0

53790,"Hi I am aged 38, trying to get pregnent. My Gynec says that I have low Follicle stimulating hormone(FSH) and she recommended Ovacare tablet twice a day. Could you suggest if Ovacare will assist me in the hormone production or you recommend any other tablet?","Hello, and I hope I can help you today.A low FSH is actually a good thing and means that you likely ovulate have normal estrogen levels.  If you menstruate regularly, it also means that you likely ovulate.Ovacare has nothing to do with helping you get pregnant, or hormone production- it is just a vitamin supplement recommended for women to take while trying to conceive to provide adequate levels at conception.So 80 percent of couples will conceive by one year if they have regular unprotected intercourse at least 3 days a week.  If you do not conceive by 9 months or so, it would be reasonable to see a fertility specialist for evaluation, which would also include your partner, since 50 percent of the time it can be a male factor.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Bets wishes, and good luck conceiving, Dr. Brown",HC,0

55348,"im taking althea oral contraceptives. on the first day, i took the pill at 4pm. on the second day at around 6pm. and on the third day at around 5pm. and from the 4th day onwards, i've been taking it at 4pm everyday. i've been taking it for 10 days now. On the first week i was taking it, i was experiencing lightheadedness, i get tired easily, and really bloated. My partner even noticed i gained weight so quickly. But what most alarms me is that i would sometimes get light sort-of-painful sensations around my belly where i would experience cramps when i have my period before. And with this, i would have a brownish discharge and (sometimes) urine, too. Is this normal? What should i do?","Hallow Dear,You seem to be from Philippines. Althea is mainly available in Philippines. These pills contain Cyproterone which is a progestational agent, and  Ethinylestradiol which is an Oestrogen product. Both these medicines cause nausea, sometimes vomiting and pain in abdomen due to the fact that they increase acidity in the stomach and secondly due to the fact that they are detoxicated in the Liver. From your history, it seems you are not consuming these pills after dinner. Please change the timings of these pills to post dinner time. On full stomach, the gastritis effect is much minimized. Stick to one specific time for consumption of these pills. Moreover, you may take some proton pump inhibitors like Pantoprazole every morning on empty stomach which will help you control the gastritis. All the gastro-enteric symptoms you are experiencing are known with the birth control pills due to hormones in them. Usually they stop after a month or so; however if they continue, you may try Pantoprazole. If still they persist, you may change the brand with the help of your Gynaecologist. The brownish discharge you had is known as breakthrough bleeding which is a hormonal effect. If it continues, you may take two pills on that day which will stop the bleeding. Yes, putting on weight is  a known (side) effect of birth control pills. It is due to water retention as well as fat deposition. You may try to control it by restriction on salt intake and consuming high protein, low fat and low carbohydrate diet. I am sure this would help you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri",HC,0

I'm concerned about her getting pregnant since she was late taking the second pill.","Hello,The chances of failure are very less even if the second pill is a few hours late, but the entire course is taken within the stipulated time. Moreover, if the unprotected intercourse happened during the safe period of her menstrual cycle, she is naturally protected. The emergency contraceptive has high hormone content and hence can cause withdrawal bleeding. The pill can also cause delayed natural period by a week or two.

If you happen to be during your fertile period when the intercourse happened, you have very good chance of conception.

Is this normal?","Hi,Though it is common during the initial months of any birth control pill for menstrual irregularities to happen, I would ask you to see a specialist since you have had persistent bleeding for the past fortnight.

Coagulation profiles and blood work is necessary to exclude any vascular factors secondary to the pill. You may need styptics and additional hormones to control the bleeding. Hope this helps.",HC,0

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, your hypersomnia, is not due to lack of ejaculation. Ask someone who sleeps near you if you are snoring in deep sleep. If yes, get your blood pressure checked. Snoring, causes less oxygen supply to the body during sleep, which is a usual cause of oversleeping.

60419,My husband and I have 4 children and have been trying for a fifth.  We are at a fertility clinic and i have been monitored all cycle and had my surge yesturday so we went in today for the iui and we were told that his sperm being injected was only 1 million and they like to see at least 5 million.  He was rushed and uncomfotable when producing the sample.  Could this have anything to do with it? We go back tomorrow for a second iui to hopefully add to the sperm inserted today.,"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment that involves placing sperm inside a woman’s uterus to facilitate fertilization. The main aim of IUI is to increase the number of sperm that reach the fallopian tubes, which would increase the chance of fertilization. Before IUI procedure, ovulation stimulating medications are used, in which there is monitoring to determine when the eggs are mature. The IUI procedure will then be performed around the time of ovulation, typically about 24-36 hours after the surge in LH hormone that indicates ovulation will occur soon. The semen sample will be washed in the lab to separate sperms from the seminal fluid. A catheter will then be used to insert the sperm directly into the uterus. The process may be repeated if the sperm count is low, thus increasing the possibility of conception.  The next step is to watch for signs and symptoms of pregnancy. Kindly follow the process as advised. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best.",HC,0

67091,I had a top pre molar extracted 3 weeks ago. It cracked after a root canal before my dentist was able to get the crown on.  Over the last couple of days I've noticed a very small smooth hard lump on the roof of my mouth kind of in line with where the pre molar was. It is sore to the touch.I'm an ex smoker so scared of the worst.What do you recommend?Thanks,"Hello, Thanks for your query.But first let me address what that hard lump is..... since it is not draining, it is most likely a cyst that has formed in the bone and grown into the hard tissue. This is seen frequently with root canaled teeth because it is caused by the bacteria that has been residing in your root canaled tooth. Not just from the ""missed canal"", but from the microscopic canals that cannot be cleaned out. So the re treatment may have removed some dead nerve material from the missed canal, but it did nothing to access the microscopic ones. Therefore, the tooth will continue to be infected. An apicoectomy is a surgical root canal, it accomplishes the same thing that a re treatment does with the exception that the surgeon physically goes in and removes the cyst.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care",HC,0

68881,taking bendryl--heard that this medicine effects your teeth,"Hello and Welcome to HCM, Thanks for writing to us. Xerostomia, regularly called cotton mouth or dry mouth, is one such side effect that you may experience from Benadryl. Dry mouth is a side effect that you might experience from Benadryl usage. While a lack of saliva might not seem like a major problem, prolonged usage of Benadryl and the subsequent appearance of cotton mouth symptoms have the potential to impact your long-term dental health. Mentioning the appearance of Xerostomia to your doctor and dentist is a good idea, as with all other unwanted and unanticipated side effects. Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health...

I will advise you to see an orthodontist first, only after a thorough dental check up, dentist can plan a treatment for you. There might be a possibility that your broken teeth will be restored with a filling if possible.

75554,"hello doctor my 4year old son has cough problem fro 1 year and alway doctor give him normal medicin and salbuta mol now i pressure on doctor for blood test and now they noticed my son has asthma problem ,,and now few hour ago i noticed that my son has left rib cage swelling i am worried about it please suggest me.","Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.i went through your son's history and would like to make suggestions for your son as follows:1. First of all, I would like to mention here that childhood asthma is very different from adult asthma. Any blood test cannot diagnose or rule out asthma. Of course, blood tests can diagnose allergies, which may be one of the causes for asthma.2. Asthma is best diagnosed by spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility testing. However, usually children below 5-6 years find it very difficult to perform such test perfectly. Hence, diagnosis of asthma at 4 years of age remains more or less of a judgment of the doctor. Detailed history of all the symptoms since infancy as well as physical examination is required for proper diagnosis.3. Regarding left rib cage swelling, I would like to know its exact location, how it appeared, when appeared, whether painful, hard, soft, moving, etc details.4. If it is painful, I would first rule out rib fracture as your child has cough for last one year. An opinion from orthopedic surgeon and an X-ray will be helpful.5. If it is not painful, there are many possibilities. Hence I would suggest you to get him examined by his doctor and then decide further.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your child the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards.",HC,0

The back pain is most probably from muscle strain due to non-ergonomic position. The knot sized swelling is mostly a hair follicular infection. The pain from muscular strain can be dealt with by applying hot water packs in the affected area. You should also take complete bedrest for a period of day keep all activities to bare minimum. Once the pain decreases it should help to do back-muscle strengthening exercises. This should prevent further episodes.

I m a healthy teenager, female. What could the issue be? The pain isn t severe, but it s enough to be bothersome and make me a little paranoid.","Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you if you eat frequently from outside specially spicy, fried and fast food kind of eatables. Such food could bring on intestinal infections, and also the intestinal mucosa could be sensitive to some of the components of the food. In both the case, you could get such symptoms in your abdomen. So avoid it and include enough roughage and liquids to your daily routine food at home. I would also advise you to get a routine stool test done for ova and cyst, and also a urine routine and microscopic test to rule out both intestinal and urinary infections, and treat these if found positive. This might relieve you of your symptoms.On the general medicinal part, I would advise you go for a proton pump inhibitor along with a prokinetic drug, and a probiotic which would an additional help in treating your symptoms. In case all these fail, I would advise you for an ultrasound whole abdomen to rule out chances of any gall stone disease, and if need be, would refer to a gastroenterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your intestinal tract.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Had blood in the urine but have had an abdominal ultrasound and they say that is fine no kidney stone and also they said the gallbladder and liver are normal. Blood work was done and all was normal he checked a number of things but was mainly interested in my liver and he said the numbers were good. Went to the gyn she did an vaginal ultrasound trying to find out why i had strange looking and thick blood, i had started my period but she wanted to check me to make sure i did not have a female problem and that was from the pain. She said the blood was thick and a little odd looking and it was heavy, so she sent me to have an ultrasound then and they said everything was normal. I have a pap next month. Sometimes the pain will run around into the groin and top of right thigh. Lately at night i have been having cramping in my hips and thighs while sleeping. Also when i had a bowel movement it did not hurt to go but right after a bowel movement maybe 5 to 10 minutes after the pain seemed to be aggrevated and i would start hurting a little worse. I have had my appedix out so we know it is not that. I have had some right side pain off and on since i was in high school which has been since 92 but i have not had it in a couple of years until. it came on me all of a sudden which it has never done before and it was like a cramp under back of my right rib cage and then it moved downward above the hip and then it moved further down like it is in the lower hip and butt area, but it has not gone away and my doctor says he does not know who to send me to or what to do. I did have a very bad urinary tract infection two weeks ago that went untreated for awhile because i don t normally have systems but when they did a urine culture it came back showing a back terrier eccolocilus, this is not the right spelling i know but they said it came from the colon. I was put on 5 days of levequin and the pain was somewhat better and know i still have the pain but it is not as bad as before. Do you have any idea what it could be. This is so frustrating. I have had about 10 to 12 cat scans over the years because of these doctors sending me in not knowing that this is harmful and could cause cancer so now the doctors dont want to do a scat scan which is understandable since i have had so many.

She had repeated upper respiratory infections. She had one ivig treatment and responded well so they removed her profalactic zithromax antibiotic.

Probably she has common variable immunodeficiency. Isolated IgA deficient children have allergic reaction to IVIg as well. There is nothing specific which can be done to prevent allergies. Only solution is to avoid substances that cause allergy and also symptomatic treatment in the form of antihistaminics (such as cetrizine), when she gets allergic complaints. She would need regular IVIg supplementation as well. I would also consider continuing antibiotic prophylaxis. Hope I have answered your question.

110014,"Hello! Some back ground- I have had 2 knee surgeries on my left knee. One in January 2011, with a torn medial meniscus (minor tear) and an ACL tear. Then a second surgery in September of 2011, with a torn medial meniscus that had to be surgically repaired.

I felt a pretty big pop and had a lot of pain on the side of my knee where my meniscus was repaired.

However, finally last night I was able to sleep and I woke up with very minimal knee pain and swelling. Originally I though I tore my meniscus again.

If the answer is yes then nothing to worry about the meniscus but exercise need to be done to strengthen your muscles especially the quadriceps, glutes, and hip adductors. If the answer is no then you need to get yourself checked by the doctor for any reinjury (till then you are not supposed to bear weight on your knee. Take rest as much as possible and start with hot packs and ice packs alternative to promote healing).Hope this answers your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Jenis Bhalavat",HC,0
111414,"thanks. I am in excruciateing pain in my right hip. I have a 3 yr old prescription for naproxen socium 550. I took one of these pills. today i have taken advil 4 total 2 @ 6am 2@ noon (little to zero relief Also took 2 aspirin at about 4 pm, Will naproxen help me? I cannot get to the dr right now. i can t move. Thank.s Lorraine","hi you are having excruciating pain in your (R) hip and are on Naproxen. In my opinion ,if you have acute pain without any history of injury then you have arthritis of hip. If the pain is severe I would recommend X Ray of the hip and if required then operation. In the meantime you can take strong pain killers .",HC,0
111666,"I have received prolotherapy, prp (which did temporary relieve all pain in my knee, but has since returned), and two stem cell procedures using adipose tissue and spaced a year apart. All this was following arthroscopic surgery, physical therapy and cocks comb injections which provided no relief. The arthroscopic surgery made the knee even worse. After the second stem cell procedure, the pain tripled in severity and the physician instructed me to take three Motrin three times daily. After no relief in pain, he told me to increase the dosage to six Motrin three times daily, but again no relief. During the adipose tissue harvesting, he had an observer present who later left with some of my stem cells, but without my then knowledge or permission. In addition, I see that lidocaine from Hospira that was used might be part of a lot that was infiltrated during manufacture with metallic particles that could lodge in injection sites or be carried to other sites and cause severe pain, stroke, or other adverse effects. I have been complaining about increasing pain at all injection sites (knee, tibia, sole of foot), but have not had any success with resolving the issue. I did receive notice that Hospira manufactured the Lidocaine, there was no record of the lot number and that the facility did not receive a notice that they were part of a recall. I was a self pay patient and all is far worse following my August 2014 treatment than I was before treatment. The doctor said that he is sorry he couldn t help me and has me talking to a nurse who I have not heard from in two weeks. I recented made an appointment with an orthopedist at a nearby tertiary hospital who spent 8 minutes with me. He asked me to tell him what the problem was, never looked at my knee, took new xrays to the tune of $1100 and then stated that he would not operate on my knee. He told me that he was going to have me see another doctor who specialized in spinal surgery (I have a 22 degree curve that does not cause pain). The office staff was not alerted to this when I asked immediately after and told me that I would be called back. This was over two months ago and I am still waiting. I have a consultation with another doctor in June for evaluation for a TJR, but am now using a cane, walker and almost ready for a wheelchair. Before the last stem cell treatment and prp I still was walking without much pain so my hypothesis is that something in the lidocaine must have initiated the pain since every spot injected hurt and continued to and even resulted in a ruptured quadracepts tendon where injected when he tried to even up my posture. I will be calling Hospira to find out whether the bad lots of lidocaine were purchased by the facility that I had the procedure done at and take it from there. What is your perspective of my situation?","Hi It seems that you have been suffering badly from pain at multiple sites, which you have correlated to injection sites. One doctor you saw recently has a  different opinion ,pointing towards spine pathology. You said that injections were given in the knee joint then why tibia or soles be involved. There is a pathology in your back bone causing curvature of spine, possibly Canal stenosis which can explain all your problem. I would suggest you undergo an MRI of your back and NCV of your legs to assess the nerve pressure.",HC,0

113505,"I am a 29 year old female who is currently terrified thinking I have RA or something like that. About 5 days ago my feet started hurting or rather aching. Its gotten a little worse and now it is switching between a dull aching and sharp pain every now and then. Both feet feel the same way and my heels hurt badly when I stand up. Almost as if I have no padding under them? It does no good to rest and put my feet up or walk. Feels the same regardless. Today was the worst yet and its extremely uncomfortable to stand. I have not done any sort of exercise, had no accidents or anything. I am self employed..work from home so Im not on my feet all day or anything like that. I do not have any swelling, redness or warmth coming from my feet. Only discomfort, aching pain. It radiates up into my ankles as well and also hurts in the tops of some of my toes off and on. Mainly the heels though. I have no prior foot problems. I currently have been taking Viibryd for about 8 weeks and I did read it can cause joint pain but feel this is probably not caused by a medication. I should also mention about a year ago or so I did have aching and tenderness in my wrists and thumbs. It lasted a few weeks and then went away and I have had no prior issues (I am a wedding photographer so I shoot weddings on the weekends a other shoots during the week so I figured I was having issues from holding my camera and editing on my computer daily). My Dr. told me to let her know if my hands started up again and that she would test me for RA. So now that this is happening with my feet I am terrified beyond belief. Im hoping there is another explanation. Everything I have read online about RA sounds terrible and basically says that it is crippling and it ruins your ability to lead a normal life.","hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As mentioned by you the brief history I do not feel you have an RA issue. As per me I feel you need to get assessed your neck and lower back region for any soft tissue Injury. As one of the thing which triggered me to think this is the symptoms of radiation. What I can say is over here it is repetitive stress injury which has got wide based of a combination of symptoms. Also, when there is nerve impingement there symptoms can occur into the distal joints and feels like something else could be there but the actual cause will be in the root of the nerve. Once traced by a clinical neuromuscular assessment and with the help of an MRI of lumbar spine one should be able to guide you better with it.Also, exercise is a wide subject to mention here but undergoing a proper physical therapy for your problem should solve your pain and aches to the maximum. Physical therapy is a non invase way of getting treated with no side effects.In my clinical practice patient come with similar complaints and have prescription on which it mentioned something else. But the root cause is the spinal nerve root. As human body lands into the degenerative phase depending upon the metabolism of each individual and life style as well. As per my personal Handson in clinic I feel you should get an MRI of lumbar spine done and see the soft tissue stauts.Also , a physical therapist will be of help to you.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel",HC,0

In addition, as your jaw is making cracking and popping sounds every time you open the jaw, it adds to the diagnosis of the TMJ problems.

This system enables our voluntary control of muscles, as well as our reception of sights, sounds, sensations, tastes and smells.- The somatic nervous system controls functions that are under conscious voluntary control such as skeletal muscles and sensory neurons of the skin. The autonomic nervous system, mostly motor nerves, controls functions of involuntary smooth muscles, cardiac muscles, and glands- Somatic (biology), referring to the cells of the body in contrast to the germ line cells. Somatic nervous system, the portion of the vertebrate nervous system which regulates voluntary movements of the bodynow since you have surgery for the cervical spine I will advice you to undergo the physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the neck.

Your doctor was correct. Calcified granuloma in the brain suggests a healed infection (due to tape worm). No treatment is required for the healed infection, however, it can cause fits. If fits recur, you may have to restart fits medications. Regarding heart beat and palpitations, it could be due to anxiety.

133763,"I am a 43 year old male. I recently had an MRI for tinnitus ear ringing in my right ear which I have had for six months consistently. The MRI showed an 8mm tonsillar herniation consistent with chiari malformation. The ENT who ordered the MRI did not think any thing of it. I have recently been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis for which I have the classic symptoms joint pain (several years), joint swelling, popping joints and mild psoriasis (20+ years). My question is is it possible that there is a connection between chiari malformation and psoriatic arthritis?","Hi, welcome to HCM.com. First of all, the chiari malformation that was picked up on your MRI may be just an incidental finding. If it is not causing you severe symptoms, there maybe nothing to worry about. Most commonly this may present as some headache and dizziness. According to me, there is no connection with your psoriatic arthritis for which you should consult a dermatologist who will start you on some tablets. If however you do develop symptoms like weakness, blurred vision or any other disturbing symptom, it is worth getting your Chiari malformation looked into by a neurologist. Wish you good health and take care. Regards,",HC,0

The doctor ' would not comfirm having MS .that is when they found the tumor on the MRI. Could this be an episode from the MS ? I am a 58 year old female.,Hi... Acoustic neuroma is a benign tumour that is seen at a region on the brain which is closed to the nerve of the ear. Because of the pressure on this nerve by the tumour you can have symptoms similar to yours like vertigo - the spining senation. You can also have symptoms like heasring difficulties. So your symptoms are more due to acoustic neuroma and not multiple sclerosis...,HC,0

We are all shocked. I do not know his weight. He is tall. I do not know his medical history. I live in Europe and he lives in South Africa. It is winter out there and he has caught a cold. Should he postpone or go ahead with the chemotherapy given that he has caught a cold? I am sorry this is all I know at the moment. I do not know what stage of the disease he is in nor if the lymphoma has spread from his lymph nodes to and organs or to his blood system. I also do not know what type of Hodgkin's Disease he has. I know there are at least 4 or 5 different types. I would be most grateful if you couls advise whether the treatment should be postponed until after he has fully recovered from the cold. Many thanks in advice for your reply.,"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is suggested that he gets a complete blood count done and then it will be known if his cold infection is of a severe grade. If there is severe infection then it will be wise to provide treatment and then allow him to recover over a week or 10 days before initiating chemotherapy.A week of wait is acceptable and the chemotherapy might be planned such that he is physically fit at the time of commencement of treatment.

135113,"My hubby who is 50years old 190lbs, 5'10"" tall, had anal cancer.  In Sept 2009, treatments included a pic-cath for 2 96 hour treatments and 30 zaps of radiation (which severely burned him) The treatments were from Oct 2009 to Dec 2009. He seems to be doing ok but the doctors never really gave him the ""all-clear"" or declared him cancer free. He has been eating a lot of nuts which he knows he is not suppose to and two days ago during a bowel movement, he had what he stated "" a load"" of blood pass. He is believing this is from eating to nuts and his anal walls being thinner from the radiation. Can you please advise on this?","Hi,Thanks for writing in.Any blood in the stool requires a colonoscopy to be done to make sure that it is not a serious concern. The blood might be from the wall of the large bowel but serious damage after radiation cannot be ruled out until the investigations are done.For clearance of cancer it is important to do regular ultrasound and CT scans as a part of surveillance. Close follow up is required to know if there is any disease spread to other organs.

So you have to get complete disease information from your aunts. Most inherited cases of breast cancer are associated with two abnormal genes: BRCA1 (BReast CAncer gene one) and BRCA2 (BReast CAncer gene two).When these genes contain abnormalities or mutations that are passed from generation to generation, the genes don't function normally and breast cancer risk increases. Abnormal BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may account for up to 10% of all breast cancers, or 1 out of every 10 cases.",HC,0
136911,good day doc. My sister has bone cancer on her pelvis and on one of her left rib. She was discharged from the hospital two days ago with pain management medications prescribed by her physician. She had slightly low hemoglobin and WBC in her CBC while she was confined in the hospital. Now she has manifested fever which rapidly rises to 40.5 Celsius and rapidly drops back to normal after 30 minutes after giving her paracetamol. What could be the possible cause in this sudden rise and fall of her temperature? She had two episodes already. Could this be related to her cancer advancing or due to an infection? Thank you.,"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your sister's situation and problem. Cancer patients are at great risk of infection because of poor immunity. So causes of on-off fever in cancer patient are1. Infection2. Release of chemical substance (cytokines and pyrogens) from the tumour. If Infection has been ruled out then tumour itself can cause fever by releasing cytokines and pyrogens from tumour mass.So give hwr paracetamol whenever she is having fever.No need to worry as this is normal in cancer, but better to rule out infection first.",HC,0

I can understand your situation and problem. Blackish inky motions are known as malena. It is due to upper GI (Gastro Intestinal ) tract bleeding. The blood is altered by stomach acid and becomes black in colour. So black stool in stomach cancer patient indicates poor prognosis.  It suggest worsening of tumour which causes bleeding.Due to blood loss in stool, anemia is unavoidable.

I met a general physician and prescribed CYPON syrup.....In the reviews i see CYPON is for more allergic treatments....can u pl advise? Thnaks, Hari","Hello and Welcome to ""Ask A Doctor"" service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The medicine in Cypon is an antihistamine and some antihistamines are  appetite stimulants. Cypon contains this kind of antihistamine.  You are correct that Cypon is more often for allergic conditions ; the Cypon antihistamine also treats people's allergies.  Side effects of appetite stimulants are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, blurred vision, fatigue, nervousness and dizziness and they should be avoided if the patient has diabetes.    Unfortunately you have shared very little about your daughter's problem.But as I wish to help you and her, allow me to take you in a direction that  just might assist you. Anorexia nervosa is a common eating disorder that affects adolescent females.  Characteristics are the patient sees herself as being too fat even when she is underweight, refuses to keep a normal body weight, intense fear of becoming fat, excessive exercise, absence of three or more menstrual cycles without another cause and denies feeling hungry.  She may be socially withdrawn, irritable, depressed, have abdominal pain, and fatigue.This condition is most serious.  IF this is what she has, it can progress to need for hospitalization and even passing away.   She needs to have a medical evaluation in more than a superficial way.This to include a complete general physical examination because the reason for poor appetite could be something else.  Should the pediatrician who does the complete physical agree that an eating disorder is possible, than your daughter needs to be evaluated by a child and adolescent psychiatrist who is experienced in treating adolescents with eating disorders.   Please think about what I have typed.  Certainly discuss with your husband.  And select a physician(hopefully a pediatrician that both of you trust) who will agree to speak with you(even if he/she requires payment)alone about her situation.  Hope I have answered your query.

As per your query your daughter have symptoms of dead tooth which seems to be due to decreased blood supply which leads to dead tooth which occurs mainly due to fall or tooth injury.

153224,My daughter was sent home from school on Monday. At first she had a bloody nose since she s had a cold with congestion and coughing at that point for maybe 4 days. Later she vomited at school and was sent home. She felt better after sleeping on Monday and felt more normal late that night. She woke up at 4 in the morning on Tuesday but was just continuing to cough and have congestion. Late Tuesday night she had another bloody nose. We stopped it with pressure and a cold wash rag. She slept with a humidifier in her room. I m also trying to get her to use the saline spray and not stick tissue in her nose to sometimes make herself sneeze. I m also trying to get her to drink water. We put a little vaseline in her nose to moisten it last night. I woke up at 4 this morning again also and heard her coughing and moving around in her bed. She then stated that she was dizzy. I got her to sit up slowly and put saline in her nose and blow gently. I then gave her some mucinex and had her eat some apple sauce and drink water. I m not sure if she should see a doctor now because I generally wait a week and a half but I m concerned due to dizziness now.,"Most probably she is having allergic rhinitisAntihistaminics, nasal decongestants are beneficialSlight pressure over soft part of nose will stop nasal bleeding",HC,0

Strangury - due to concentrated urine. Give him a glass of sugar water followed by 2 glasses of normal water and this will settle the issue if he passes large amount of urine.2. Balanoposthitis - please consult a pediatrician as this  might require antibiotic therapy.3. Urinary tract infection - Unlikely as there is no high grade fever or vomiting.

154836,"My 5 year daughter (weight 15 kg) is suffering from seasonal allergies resulting in persistent cough (but occassional) for a few months. We keep her on nebuliser medication (Levolin and Budesal). Visited a new doctor who prescribed omnacortil 5 ml daily to her. Is it safe and advisable under current situation, I see that it is a steroid.","Steroids are very helpful and should be given for life saving efforts. Under present conditions these may be good. My own recommendation is to create immunity in the child to avoid life long recurrence of such situations. Some exclusive classical Ayurveda preparations having Piper longum herb as main ingredient such as in Bachaturbhadrika chooran (a combo of four unquestionable herbs) is boon to child care. Another classical medicine named '64 prahari peepal' is also such presentation. Selection depends on various aspects. In any case these are harmless, safe, no side effects, no interaction with modern drugs. These are given with honey independently or with other things. May be being natural these are bit slower and may need 4 to 8 weeks of treatment too but when result sustains for very long durations and immunity in body is created, can't parents bear little bit?My three decades of experience in clinics of Ayurveda has taught me these things. Globally my child patients have been corrected.I do say that antibiotics, steroids save lives in acute conditions not manageable by Ayurveda and are great but not for such diseases which need immunity to check recurrence.If you agree and need further guidance, pl consult by direct question and give more details.Hope its helpful to you too.",HC,0

It will clear the way.Then chebulic myrobalan may be ground against clean, hard, rough stoned object in kitchen etc by adding drops of water and get the extract and give to your baby (simply allow her to lick).

The second episode was on 29th of July and now she is 4 yrs old. she weighs 15Kgs and iam not sure bout her height. She was taken to Paedeatric Neurologist and he suggested that as parents for your satisfaction we can have EEG test done which will assess the risk in future. I stay in bangalore and would like to know what extent it is required to conduct the test.,"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,Seizures within 24hrs of onset of fever and lasting less than 5 mins is commonly seen in this age group children till 6 yrs. Especially if there is a strong family history of febrile seizures then there is much more possibility if this. It usually doesn't happen of the fever is controlled well from the very onset. Its called simple febrile seizures and if that is the case, no investigation is required. But if any atypical features like, seizure onset after 24 hrs of fever onset, more than 1 episode in 24hrs, occuring beyond 6 yrs, child has development delay etc needs evaluation with eeg.Having said that, getting an eeg done just for completion is not a harm.

He had been initially prescribed ONDEM syrup for vomiting and paracetamal. LATER ON AT NIGHT he hasbeen prescribed to take TAXIM O 100. Is it correct treatment ? My email id is YYYY@YYYY","Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Ondem syrup can control vomiting but not fever. See your doctor about the dosage as it depends on the weight of your child. Ondem can be given 30 minutes before feeding to reduce excess spit-up. To reduce the fever paracetamol needs to be given.If it does not work and the temperature stays up past 99 then go to the hospital.Taxim-O is a brand of cefixime, an antibiotic which would only be effective in managing any secondary bacterial infection that may occur alongside the viral infections. But irrespective of the use of antibiotics, viral infections take 5 to 7 days to recover.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Diptanshu Das",HC,0

Please note that since last 3 days he has 7-8 bowel movement (loose sticky green stool with lots of bubble and mucus) a days and he is urinating just 2-3 times a days. His weight is 7 kg. Thanks, Kinjal","The stool examination you have got done says 30-40 pus cells, that is likely to be a sign of gastro-intestinal infection. For that he needs to be treated with an antibiotic. The frequency of urine has also come down. Your baby urinating 2-3 times a days is a sign for dehydration and needs to be managed with plenty of fluids to drink.You have to watch(low urine out put,sunken eyes, Absent tear less, drowsiness, lethargy, abdominal distention, restlessness etc.) Pediatric opinion: 1. If your child is dehydrated. 2. Stool with blood 3. Stool with mucus (White sticky discharge) 4. High grade fever. I would advice: Keep your baby hydrated, most important condition. Is your baby fully breastfed? If yes continue breast feeding in increased frequency. No other fluids essential if urine frequency normalises. If not exclusively breast fed:1.Give plenty of water(1/2 liter water+ 4 tsf sugar+ 1/2 tsf salt) Or ORS 2.Apple juice, Tea, Pomegranate juice, Coconut water, lemon water Butter milk, Rice etc 3. Proper hygiene. 4 Avoid out side food.Hope that helps you.",HC,0

He is aged 1.5 yrs. Thanks in advnce, manoj","Your child is suffering from a respiratory tract infection which is likely to be caused by a virus. As he is trying to cough out the thick mucus, the gag is triggering a vomiting but not otherwise. Zyrtec (cetirizine) is an antiallergic which relieves the allergic component of such infections and should be given for a few days to relieve the khitch khitch. Give him steam inhalation or nebulisation if possible. The water in the form of vapour or fine particles will reach deep into the lungs and help in diluting the cough and give him relief. Asthalin contains Salbutamol which is a bronchodilator and needs to be given if the child has wheezing. It can best be delivered by nebulisation but syrup is another alternative.",HC,0

She is all day active but few times in a day complains about stomach ache and this is more worse when she starts eating food and half way complains about stomach pain and passes stool and then she is alright - this is getting continued daily and I have again took my daughter to the same doctor he said it is a Digestive disorder and suggested to continue mucus gel syrup and prescribed kids antacid tablet suggested to take before breakfast and dinner and told us to observe the stool color(which is yellow). It is almost eight days now my daughter is still in same condition - request you to please suggest something.","Hi, Welcome to HCM. I appreciate the fact that you are really concerned about your daughter. You can definitely help her by firstly giving her the mental strength to believe and accept that this is temporary and she need not fear. Secondly, you have taken to the doctor and she is on medication for the same which is the best thing you have done. Thirdly, I would want to emphasise on you checking on her diet. There is a possibility of food poisoning, infection in the stomach etc beacuse you have mentioned that the pain began only after she ate outside food. Symptoms of food poisoning include vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, and even slight fever. With regards to diet, you need to ensure she drinks a lot of fluids in the form of plain wated, juices, soups etc to make up for the lost fluids through vomiting. She should be well hydrated. She can consume bland foods that will not irritate her digestive system such as rice, milk, banana, soft breads etc. Give some nuts for protein intake. Ensure you do not give heavy foods because you need to give time for the stomach to get back to normal. Avoid spicy, sweet, sour, bitter foods. Try to keep the diet very simple and bland so that the virus/bacteria does not have suitable conditions to grow. Diet along with medication shall definitely help her tackle the situation. If condition persists beyond  week agaain, consult a doctor for more tests. Good luck!!!",HC,0

Smells.  I am 56.  I prefer underwire.  Perhaps I've gained weight, my bras are uncomfortable.  I thank you, just want to know if it's anything to worry about, and what I can do about it.","Hello! I have been through your question.Related your concern I think this could be yeast (Candidiasis) infection. Furthermore you should know that when a rash is present in an area where skin on skin contact occurs, this is known as intertrigo.  Intertrigo is inflammation of the skinfolds that is caused by increased moisture and friction in the areas where skin meets skin.  The area with intertrigo can produce intense itching, burning sensations and it may also have a terrible foul smell similar with your symptoms.  The inflamed skin under the breasts can be an open door for Candida.  What I suggest for you is  to keep dry your underbust,minimize moisture and friction with absorptive powder, wear light, non-constricting,and  get the right type of bra. Meanwhile meet a doctor to start local antimycotic therapy.I hope my answer helps you. I wish you a quick recovery.",HC,0

It is one of the most common caused of antibiotic associated opportunistic infection resulting in severe bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, dehydration, etc. The recurrent infection which sometimes occurs in about 30-40% of cases following a course of antibiotics (such as Metronidazole and Vancomycin) does not cause dysplasia of the colon.

I went to a physician and got some antibiotics ( Z pack) which after a few days I m feeling much better BUT I m having lots of pain in my kidneys/ lower back now. Is there something else going on? I have no change or pain with urination . This is not a usual pain I have. I have been getting sick on and off all winter. Is this a normal flu symptom? Is there some ways I can treat this post-flu symptom at home? Thank you!,"Welcome to HCM!You should rule out kidney condition, if any, by doing certain investigations:Ultrasound KUB, X-ray KUB, CBC, RFT, Urine routine exam.If any stone is found, or any other kidney condition, consult your Urologist.Till then you may take antispasmodics, analgesics, pre- & pro-biotics with your doctor's opinion.Drink plenty of water so that at least 2 litres of urine is voided in 24 hrs.Wish you a speedy recovery!With warm regards.Thanks.",HC,0
197782,"i got married on 1st feb. ,during first month of my marriage i didnt had any problem during sex, but frm second month i see little blood during our intercourse. after examination the doc said thr is a small mole/poly or anything.so the doc advised tat it should be romed immediately.I havent understood the reason for this and also in ultra sound  report its seen tat a calculus is seen in mird 3rd of right kidney measuring 3.3 mm in size, thr are features of endocervictis, small cortical cyst is seen in both the ovaries and minimal collection is seen in POD? what should i do now, what are the remedies? will i have any problem in conceiving a child???pls help??","Hi,Thank you for your query.You have not mentioned the location of the mole/polyp. If it is on the cervix then it should be removed. Endocervicitis can be controlled by appropriate medications.The kidney problems should not be a cause for worry if the kidney functions are within normal limits. The doctor shall be seeing to this aspect.Cortical cyst in ovaries and minimal collection of fluid in the POD are normal. These should not cause any problem for you to conceive. However you need to be under constant medical supervision for your renal problems.I hope I have answered your query to your satisfaction.Wishing you all the best.Regards,Rajiv K Khandelwal",HC,0
197801,"I had an acute kidney infection on my right side and was hospitalized for six days. I was released from the hospital ten days ago and have been taking augmentin since then. I keep getting a tingly feeling In my left arm and my left hand seems to go numb a little, especially my pinkie.could this be related to my kidney issue?","Hi.  No, this wouldn't be related to the kidney infection but it sounds like a pinched nerve, either at the level of your elbow or perhaps a compressed nerve root in your neck.

202999,Lately l went to ultrasound of the upper abdomen.There is a stone about 5mm noted within the gallbladder lumen.What shall l do next? when l standing walking and doing routing work everthing fine but when l sleep at night and turn around l fill discomfort all the time,"hi.noted history of gallstones via ultrasonography. in early stages of gallstone formation, it is possible for the sludges or smaller stones to dissolve with the medication intake. but if it's already big and is numerous, the chance for it to dissolve is less, causing the symptoms to ensue despite medication intake. if the symptoms are bothersome, persistent, or increasing in frequency of occurrence, it is best to consult with a doctor with urgency, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. diagnostics (such as repeat ultrasound, blood count, liver function tests, etc.) and management (medical and surgical)  will be directed accordingly. cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment, which could be done laparoscopically (goldstandard) or thru open technique. low fat diet is also recommended.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye",HC,0

204194,"My nephew is in the hospital with Hepatitis C. His conditioning is worsening each day. I know there is a medication that is on the market now, but the cost is $1000 per pill. His most recent symptom is that his testicles have swollen to grapefruit size. Is this one of the symptoms of the infection spreading in his organs?",HiGreetings from Dr.Divakara.P     No I don't think it is a symptom of Hepatitis C spreading to testes.      Due to severe hepatitis it damages the liver and because of the liver damage the protein production gets reduced. If the protein concentration in the blood reduces then it can cause swellings in legs or face or in testes.     I would recommend him to get Serum Albumin levels which will confirm that protein levels are low If at all it is in normal range then an ultrasound Scan of scrotum has to be done.Hope this information was useful to you.Any clarification feel free to ask.Regards.,HC,0

Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, and fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You can get prescribed tab Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast once a day for 2 weeks.  Secondly, it can be heart problem as well, it is more likely if you have associated sweating, left arm pain. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity at least 30 min a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There shouldn't abdominal fat deposition or obesity.

Diuretics (or water pills) and beta blockers are two classes of blood pressure lowering medication that are known to cause problems with sexual performance. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker and this group of medications rarely causes erection problems.Rather than a medication side effect of amlodipine, erectile dysfunction might actually be a sign of inadequate control of blood pressure. High blood pressure damages blood vessels, reducing the blood flow to the penis and thus making it more difficult to achieve and sustain an erection.

242041,"Hi I am a female and 28 years old. I have been loosing my hair, wanting to sleep all day long and have not been wanting to eat very much. The hair loss has been going on for a couple months but the other stuff have gotten worse over the last 2 weeks.","Hello,Thank you for posting on HCM.I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall. Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions,drugs,cosmetic products etc.From your description, it seems you might be having Telogen Effluvium, which is hairfall secondary to stress.If i were your dermatologist/trichologist, i would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma/illness/stress/medications etc and recommend some basic investigations like CBC,blood sugar,Thyroid function test.Some other special investigations like trichogram and dermoscopy and further aid in diagnosis and prognosis.I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals for minimum 3 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera etc). I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week.Also enquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like mesotherapy and platelet-rich plasma.Avoid combing in wet hair and let them dry by wrapping in towel. Avoid blow dryers and hair-color/dyes. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and try to de-stress your routine life.Hope your queries are resolved and wish you best of health.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda",HC,0

242272,its been 2 years for our marriage and we never used condoms during our sex but had safe sex as he never left his white liquid inside my vagina.

Is it possible that because of this I am unable to conceive. Pls guide me further on what can be done for positive results. There is no such medical history of mine.,"Hello, Thank you for your query. *how old are both of you? If below 30yrs, try by yourselves for upto a year. If above 30, try for a couple more months before seeing a fertility specialist. I recommend :- regular intercourse, every alternate day atleast, during the middle third of your cycle. -basal body temperature monitoring and ovulation prediction kits can help to detect ovulation day. This day and three days prior to this are your most fertile period. Time intercourse appropriately. -take a folic acid supplement everyday. Improper /irregular intercourse, Thyroid problems, hormonal imbalances, obesity, stressful life can all affect fertility. Minimize caffeine, exercise and eat a healthy diet. Urine infection:- drink plenty of water-avoid spicy foods and carbonated drinks-maintain regular hygiene. If symptoms persist more than 5 days of the above measures,:-see a OBGYN - to check for vaginal Infection as well-urine analysis. Treat according to results. A urine infection will not interfere with getting pregnant but a vaginal Infection can. Hope this helps and you conceive soon. Wish you good health",HC,0
242614,I was in hospital at the end of January excessive bleeding & clotting .. tests done all clear and was advised to have implanon implant out ASAP which I did.. Weeks following I had unprotected sex with my new partner & still have not had a period although I had pregnancy urine & blood tests done over 2 weeks ago which proved negative? Could I still be pregnant and should I do another urine test? Thank you.. .. never mind I will see my GP again who bulk bills my account & try & find out what is going on..,"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1 ) First of all do not panic. 2 ) I will suggest you to get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy, at least 15 to 20 days after your last episode of unprotected sex act. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help. Tests done earlier than this period may not give predictable results. 3 ) If you are not pregnant then you can simply wait for the onset of periods or induce the periods with progesterone tablets. Your treating doctor can guide you further about it. 4 ) Even If you are pregnant, you can opt for termination of the pregnancy with medicines safely till 9 weeks of pregnancy under medical supervision. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks. Dr. Purushottam Neurgaonkar",HC,0

244414,Hi I have had a rash that starred when I was pregnant with my twins. It started on my right thigh and has then spread to both arms stomach and pubic area. When I was pregnant my Dr insisted that it was pupps. My twins are now 11 weeks old and the rash is still there and itchy. The odd thing is that my children are getting this rash as well. I m waiting on insurance so that I can go to a Dr or dermatologist so that I can find a solution to this. It is absolutely horrible and embarrasing.,"Hi, There are two common possible diagnoses as per your complaint, one is Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) which is non-contagious and remits after pregnancy. Secondly, your rash could be Scabies which is contagious and associated with severe itching at night. As your children are also having the rash, the chances for the rash being scabies is high. So, I recommend you to consult your Dermatologist to arrive at the final diagnosis and to manage accordingly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

You can first start with using anti fungal creams and tablets for first 2 weeks and then decide whether to continue it or not.The usual course is of 4 weeks . If you don't respond in first 2 weeks then switch over to a steroid cream.Along with this you can take any anti histaminic tablet like cetrizine to relieve itching.

You was on both brief and pant. You did fingered your girlfriend without touching to penis. If you have touched penis then also extremely less sperm can attache to finger. By fingering, sperm can not enter in to vagina. Sperm require seminal fluid as a liquid medium for movement inside uterus. To become pregnant, penetrative sexual intercourse with or without ejaculation during fertile period of cycle is required. Use condom in future to prevent unwanted pregnancy.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If ejaculation occurs near vagina, though rare but there is a possibility of pregnancy. There are some reports of pregnancy occurring in such a scenario. But in your case, if you have regular cycles, it means that you are now in safe period. A week before the start of period is safe period. Unprotected sex during this period does not cause pregnancy. So you will not get pregnant. Hope I have answered your query.

In the present scenario, you should ideally wait for some time before trying to conceive again as your uterus seem to be very irritable. Please consult a specialist in high risk pregnancies for further evaluation and help. After your uterus seems to have settled, say in about a couple of months, you can try once again and with appropriate precautions taken soon after and before conception. Hope this helps.",HC,0
